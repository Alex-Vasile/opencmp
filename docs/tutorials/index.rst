Tutorials
=========

These tutorials are inspired by the excellent deal.ii tutorials and similarly aim to provide a roadmap for OpenCMP's general functionality. The files needed to run the tutorials can be found in the "Examples" folder under the given tutorial name. Before beginning the tutorials the user should install OpenCMP following the instructions given in the :ref:`installation_guide`.

The beginner user is advised to follow the tutorials in order at least until their model of interest is discussed. After completing the tutorials the user can refer to the various other examples in the "Examples" folder for templates of each model. A list of all possible configuration file options is given in :ref:`example_config` and :ref:`syntax` provides a quick reference for the configuration file syntax.
