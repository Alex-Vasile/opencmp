Mathematical Notes
==================

The following provide the finite element weak forms used in OpenCMP in standard mathematical notation. They may be of interest to those using OpenCMP who wish to understand the exact numerical methods. Users who wish to add/modify OpenCMP models are also advised to read through these notes before jumping into the code implementation.
