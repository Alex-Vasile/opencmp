Dear Editor,
    Please find our manuscript entitled "OpenCMP: An Open-Source Computational Multiphysics Package" that we are submitting for consideration as a new submission to the Journal of Open Source Software. OpenCMP is a computational multiphysics software package based on the finite element method and is primarily intended for physicochemical processes in which fluid convection plays a significant role. OpenCMP uses the NGSolve finite element library for spatial discretization and provides a configuration file-based interface for pre-implemented models and time discretization schemes. It also integrates with Netgen and Gmsh for geometry construction and meshing. Additionally, it provides users with built-in functionality for post-processing, error analysis, and data export for visualisation using Netgen or ParaView.

Please note that, until recently, only one of the authors (E.J. Monte) has been committing to the public Github repository due to our research group primarily using internally-hosted version control. All listed authors have made significant contributions to the software and we are able to provide proof through our internal (Mercurial) version control logs, if needed.

We confirm that the submitted work is original and unpublished/unsubmitted to another peer-reviewed publication venue.

We look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience,

Sincerely,

--
