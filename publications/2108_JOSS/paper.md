# Summary

OpenCMP is a computational multiphysics software package based on the finite element method [@Ferziger2002]. It is primarily intended for physicochemical processes in which fluid convection plays a significant role. OpenCMP uses the NGSolve finite element library [@ngsolve] for spatial discretization and provides a configuration file-based interface for pre-implemented models and time discretization schemes. It also integrates with Netgen [@ngsolve] and Gmsh [@Geuzaine2009] for geometry construction and meshing. Additionally, it provides users with built-in functionality for post-processing, error analysis, and data export for visualisation using Netgen [@ngsolve] or ParaView [@Ahrens2005]. 

OpenCMP development follows the principles of ease of use, performance, and extensibility. The configuration file-based user interface is intended to be concise, readable, and intuitive. Furthermore, the code base is structured such that experienced users with appropriate background can add their own models with minimal modifications to existing code. The finite element method enables the use of high-order polynomial interpolants for increased simulation accuracy, however, continuous finite element methods suffer from stability and accuracy (conservation) for fluid convection-dominated problems. OpenCMP addresses this by providing discontinuous Galerkin method [@Cockburn2000] solvers, which are locally conservative and improve simulation stability for convection-dominated problems. Finally, OpenCMP implements the diffuse interface method [@Monte2021,@Nguyen2018], an immersed boundary method [@Mittal2005], which allows complex simulation domains to be meshed by non-conforming structured meshes for improved simulation stability and reduced computational complexity (under certain conditions [@Monte2021]).

# Statement of Need

Simulation-based analysis continues to revolutionise the engineering design process. Simulations offer a fast, inexpensive, and safe alternative to physical prototyping for preliminary design screening and optimisation. Simulations can also offer more detailed insight into the physical phenomena of interest than is feasible from experimentation. Computational multiphysics is an area of particular importance since coupled physical and chemical processes are ubiquitous in science and engineering.

However, there are several barriers to more wide spread use of simulations. One such barrier is a lack of suitable software accessible to the general scientific and engineering community. Many of the most widely-used computational multiphysics software packages, such as COMSOL Multiphysics [@comsol] or ANSYS Fluent [@fluent], are closed-source and cost-prohibitive. Furthermore, the predominance of the finite volume method for fluid dynamics simulations inherently limits simulation accuracy for a given mesh compared to the finite element method [@Ferziger2002]. Open-source packages that uses the finite element method, such as the computational multiphysics software MOOSE [@Permann2020] or the finite element libraries NGSolve [@ngsolve] and FEniCS [@Alnaes2015], have very steep learning curves and are inaccessible to the general scientific and engineering communities.

A second barrier is the complex geometries inherent to many real-world problems. Conformal meshing of these complex geometries is time and labour intensive and frequently requires user-interaction, making conformal mesh-based simulations infeasible for high-throughput design screening of many industrially-relevant processes [@Yu2015]. A possible solution is the use of immersed boundary methods [@Mittal2005] to allow the use of non-conforming structured meshes - simple and fast to generate - for any geometry. Use of structured meshes can also potentially improve simulation stability compared to unstructured meshes [@Yu2015]. The diffuse interface method, a form of immersed boundary method, has been shown by Monte *et al* [@Monte2021] to significantly speed up inherently low accuracy simulations - such as those used for preliminary design screening and optimisation - compared to conformal mesh-based simulations. Providing an easy-to-use publicly available implementation of said method would enable broader use by the research community and further development.

The goal of OpenCMP is to fill this evident need for an open-source computational multiphysics package which is user friendly, based on the finite element method, and which includes the diffuse interface method. OpenCMP is built on top of the NGSolve finite element library [@ngsolve] to take advantage of its extensive finite element spaces and high performance solvers and preconditioners. OpenCMP provides pre-implemented models and a configuration file-based user interface in order to be accessible to the general simulation community, not just finite element experts. The user interface is designed to be intuitive, readable, and requires no programming experience - solely knowledge of the command line interface. Users must choose the model that suites their application, but need no experience with the actual numerical implementation of said model. Finally, OpenCMP provides the only publicly available implementation of the diffuse interface method.

# User Interface

Drawing inspiration from packages like [OpenFOAM](https://openfoam.org/) and [SU2](https://su2code.github.io/), OpenCMPâ€™s user  interface is organized around configuration files and the command line.  Each simulation requires its own directory to hold its configuration  files and outputs. This is known as the run directory or `run_dir/`. The  standard layout of this directory is shown below.

![](images/user_interface.svg)

The main directory and each subdirectory contain a configuration file  `< >_config`. These are plaintext files that specify the  simulation parameters and run conditions.

The configuration file in the main directory contains general information about the simulation including which model, mesh, finite  element spaces, and solver should be used. It also contains information about how the simulation should be executed such as the level of detail in the output messages and the number of threads to use.

The `bc_dir/` subdirectory contains information about the boundary conditions. Its configuration file specifies the type and value of each  boundary condition. This subdirectory also contains files describing boundary condition data if a boundary condition value is to be loaded  from file instead of given in closed form.

The `ic_dir` subdirectory holds information about the initial  conditions. Its configuration file specifies the value of the initial condition for each model variable. Like `bc_dir/`, `ic_dir/` may contain  additional files from which the initial condition data is loaded during  the simulation.

The `model_dir/` subdirectory contains information about model parameters and model functions. Its configuration file specifies the values of any model parameters or functions for each model variable and the  subdirectory may hold additional data files to be loaded during the  simulation.

The `ref_sol_dir/` subdirectory contains information about the error analysis to be conducted on the final simulation result. Its configuration file specifies what error metrics should be computed during post-processing. This configuration file also contains the  reference solutions the results should be compared against, either in closed form or as references to other files in the subdirectory that are loaded during post-processing.

The `output/` subdirectory contains the saved simulation data. It  does not need to be created before running the simulation, it will be generated automatically if results should be saved to file.
